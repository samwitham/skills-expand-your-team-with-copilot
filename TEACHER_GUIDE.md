## Why This Works

- **No coding required** - just fill out forms
- **Complete information** - templates ask for everything developers need
- **Faster results** - no back-and-forth questions
- **AI-friendly** - works great with Copilot coding assistants

## Examples

- "Add Chess Club on Mondays 3-5pm, max 12 students"
- "Change Math Club from Tuesday to Thursday due to room conflict"
- "Students can't sign up - getting error message"
- "Add notification when activity is full"
- "Need new teacher account for Ms. Johnson"
- "Login button is hard to find on mobile"
