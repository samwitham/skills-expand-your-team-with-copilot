        ## Implementation Details for Developer
        
        **Database Changes Needed:**
        - Add new activity to `initial_activities` dictionary in `src/backend/database.py`
        - Activity object should include: description, schedule, schedule_details (days, start_time, end_time), max_participants, participants (empty array)
        
        **Files to Modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Add activity to initial_activities
        - Consider if any category filtering needs to be updated in frontend
        
        **Testing Requirements:**
        - Verify activity appears in activities list
        - Test activity signup/unregister functionality
        - Verify schedule filtering works correctly
        - Check capacity limits are enforced
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - âœ… New activity appears on the main activities page
        - âœ… Students can sign up for the activity
        - âœ… Teachers can register/unregister students
        - âœ… Activity respects maximum participant limit
        - âœ… Schedule information displays correctly
        - âœ… Activity can be filtered by day and time
