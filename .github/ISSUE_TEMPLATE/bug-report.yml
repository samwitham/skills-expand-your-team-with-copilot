        ## Implementation Details for Developer
        
        **Investigation Areas:**
        - Check relevant API endpoints in `src/backend/routers/`
        - Review error handling in affected components
        - Verify database operations in `src/backend/database.py`
        - Check frontend JavaScript in `src/static/app.js`
        - Review authentication logic if login-related
        
        **Common Bug Locations:**
