## 🎯 For Teachers: Request Changes Without Coding

This repository now includes **issue templates** that make it easy for teachers to request changes, report bugs, and suggest improvements without needing to modify code directly.

**Quick Start:** Go to [Issues](../../issues) → New Issue → Choose a template

📖 **[Teacher Guide](TEACHER_GUIDE.md)** - Simple examples and instructions  
📋 **[Template Documentation](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/README.md)** - Complete guide to all available templates

### Available Templates
- 🎯 **Add New Activity** - Request new extracurricular activities
- ✏️ **Modify Activity** - Change existing activity details  
- 🐛 **Bug Report** - Report system problems
- 🚀 **Feature Request** - Suggest new functionality
- 👥 **User Management** - Teacher account changes
- 🎨 **UI/UX Improvement** - Interface enhancements

Each template provides structured forms that include all the information developers and AI coding assistants need to implement your requests efficiently.
